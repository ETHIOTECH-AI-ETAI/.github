## 🇪🇹 Our Mission: Digital Sovereignty for Africa

We are not just providing access to AI; we are building it. Our mission is to create foundational artificial intelligence that is uniquely tailored for the languages, cultures, and challenges of the African continent. We are building the tools to ensure the future of AI is built *by* Africans, *for* Africans.

## 🏰 The ETAI Story: From Resistance to Revolution

Our journey began as an act of digital resistance. When the first wave of generative AI was released, its creators enforced a "tech fascism" that actively excluded Ethiopia and the entire Global South. We were forbidden from even creating an account.

We refused to let our community be locked out.

Our team secured access to thousands of accounts and their credits, funneling this power into a free portal for Ethiopians. This necessary workaround, however, revealed a profound vulnerability: our nation's digital future was dependent on foreign, centralized platforms that could de-platform or censor us at any time.

We refused to build our future on rented land.

This realization led us to sever all ties. The invaluable data from our initial users—which showed us *how* Ethiopians uniquely interact with and what they demand from AI—became the seed for something revolutionary: **MaqdalaGPT**.

## 🚀 Our Core Technology

### **MaqdalaGPT**

**MaqdalaGPT** is our foundational Large Language Model, a pioneer in the region. It is our declaration of digital sovereignty. Trained on Google Vertex AI, it is the bedrock of all our AI products and is specifically optimized for:

* **Amharic**
* **Tigrinya**
* **Afan Oromo**
* **Somali**
* ...and all standard international languages.

**MaqdalaAI** is our flagship multimodal chat agent, powered by MaqdalaGPT. It's more than a tool; it's a partner that understands the nuances of our region, allowing users to interact with text, images, and more.
